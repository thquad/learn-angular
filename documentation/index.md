## Learn Angular

This project or documentation is not a comprehensive explanation of Angular, but tries to give some examples for later reference and describe the concepts in a concise manner, so that people with some knowledge in Angular can immediately understand the most important key concepts.

Mostly it's my personal notes in the form of a project.
